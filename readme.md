# Beinecke MS 408

This is a repository for a transcription of [Beinecke MS 408](https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/2002046) (the infamous Voynich manuscript). Also, I began adding some fun with statistics.

- The transcript (work in progress based on Takeshi Takahashiâ€™s transliteration) is available in `/transcript`.
- Data can be found in `/analysis`, together with a Jupyter Notebook for analysis with Python.
